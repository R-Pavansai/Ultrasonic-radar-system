# Ultrasonic-radar-system
The application of radio detection and ranging in different places such as
military installation, commercial use is done with the help of RADAR SYSTEM which uses
electromagnetic waves for detection of different physical components such as distance,
speed, position, range, direction, size etc which can be either fixed or be in motion. Use of
radar system has been developed greatly specially in field of navigation. In this research we
study about existing navigation technologies and proposed an Arduino based radar system.
It has advantage over other radar system
